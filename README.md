Fixed off-hand attack compatability with spartan weaponry. In the original mod,
damage values were incorrect and weapon bonuses (such as extra damage to undead)
were being applied to the other hand. This lead to some overpowered interactions.
Additionally, enchantments in the main-hand were being applied to the off-hand
weapon.
